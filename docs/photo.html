  <div class="container min-vh-50 pt-5">
    <p>The photographs on the trip were taken by Yokoyama Matsusaburō 横山松三郎, a Tokyo-based photographer who had been exposed to oil painting and photography in his native Hokkaido before studying with Shimooka Renjō 下岡蓮杖 in Yokohama and eventually opening his own studio in Tokyo. Yokoyama had already collaborated with Ninagawa the previous year, 1871, on photographs to document Edo castle, the former residence of the shoguns.</p>
    <p>In Japan in the early 1870s, the procedure of using photography to document ancient sites and artifacts was far from established, nor could the photographs yet be reproduced by ordinary printing methods such as collotype or photogravure for the benefit of a mass viewership. Photographers were using the wet collodion process, which offered admirable clarity but was extremely challenging to execute outside of the studio, for it involved treating a glass plate and submerging it in silver nitrate in a darkroom before inserting it, still wet, into the camera. The heavy and fragile plates needed to be transported to and from the location before they could be developed or used to make a paper print. Thus, the photographs of the Jinshin Inspection Tour in 1872 could not be widely disseminated beyond individual prints generated from the negatives. Because of this, they could be said to represent an earlier moment in the history of Japanese photography in the 1870s. In Europe, as well, it was not easy to generate books illustrated with photographic prints in the early 1870s, meaning that the Orientalist modes of photographing Japanese antiquities had yet to become widely disseminated. By nature, photographic documentation of the Jinshin inspection tour was not entangled with the Western Orientalist drive to acquire and comprehend Eastern objects, but instead was far more continuous with earlier, pre-photographic approaches toward documenting antiquities.</p>
